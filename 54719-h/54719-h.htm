<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> volume has been garnered from the author's earlier
books. Two poems have been chosen from "The White Sail" (1887);
nine Oxford Sonnets from a privately printed booklet (1895), since
added to, and much altered; and many lyrics, under a revised form,
from "A Roadside Harp" (1893), and "The Martyrs' Idyl" (1899), plus
some twenty newer titles transferred, with grateful acknowledgments,
from <i>McClure's Magazine</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Scribner's</i>,
and <i>The Century</i>. The principle of exclusion goes far enough to
cover all poems in narrative form, or of any appreciable length, or
translated; also, any which seemed out of keeping with the character
of the present collection. Such as that is, it comprises the less
faulty half of all the author's published verse.</p>

<span class="smcap">While</span> all was glad,<br />
It seemed our birch-tree had,<br />
That August hour, intelligence of death;<br />
For warningly against the eaves she beat<br />
Her body old, lamenting, prophesying,<br />
And the hot breath<br />
Of ferny hollows nestled at her feet<br />
Spread out in startled sighing.<br />
<br />
Across an argent sea,<br />
Distinct unto the farthest reef and isle,<br />
The clouds began to be.<br />
Huge forms 'neath sombre draperies, awhile<br />
Made slow uncertain rally;<br />
But as their ranks conjoined, and from the north<br />
The leader shook his lance, Oh, then how fair<br />
Unvested, they stood forth,<br />
In diverse armour, plumed majestically,<br />
Each with his own esquires, a King in air!<br />
<br />
Up moved the dark vanguard,<br />
With insolent colours that o'erdusked the skies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-6-</a></span><br />
And trailed from beach to beach:<br />
Massed orange and mould-green; vermilion barred<br />
On bronze or mottled silver; saffron dyes<br />
And purples migratory<br />
Fanned each in each,<br />
As the long column broke, athirst for glory.<br />
<br />
Sudden, the thunder!<br />
Upon the roofed verandas how it rolled,<br />
Twice, thrice: a thud and flame of doom that told<br />
New-fallen, nor far away,<br />
Some black destruction on the innocent day.<br />
And little Everard<br />
Deep in the hammock under, eyes alight<br />
With healthful fear and wonder<br />
The brave do ne'er unlearn,<br />
Clenched his soft hand, and breathing hard,<br />
Smiled there against his father, like a knight<br />
Baptized on Cressy field or Bannockburn.<br />
<br />
A moment gone,<br />
Into our paradise from Acheron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-7-</a></span><br />
With imperceptive sorcery crawled ashore<br />
Odours unnamable: an exhalation<br />
Of men and ships in oozy graves. (Ah, cease,<br />
Derisive nereids! cease:<br />
Be it enough, that even ye can pour,<br />
From crystal flagons of your ancient peace,<br />
So strange obscene libation.)<br />
But with the thunder-peal<br />
Sprang the pure winds, their thurible swung wide,<br />
To chase that tainted tide;<br />
Fresh from the pastures and the cedar-grove,<br />
They rode the copper ridges of the main,<br />
And bared a league of distance to reveal<br />
A sail, aslant, astrain,<br />
Impetuous for the cove;<br />
And tossing after, panic-stricken,<br />
Another, and a third: white spirits, fain to sicken,<br />
Nor out of natural harm salvation gain.<br />
<br />
The selfsame hunter winds that drave<br />
The horror down, as faithful-hearted drew<br />
The sad clouds from their carnage, and up-piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-8-</a></span><br />
Their rebel gonfalons, or jocund threw<br />
Their cannon in the wave;<br />
And subtly, with a parting whisper, gave<br />
An eve most mild:<br />
A sunset like a prayer, a world all rose and blue:<br />
<br />
A good world, as it was,<br />
And as it shall be: clear circumferent space,<br />
Where punctual yet, for worship of their Cause,<br />
The stars came thick in choir.<br />
Sleep had our Everard in her cool embrace,<br />
Else from his cot he hardly need have stooped<br />
To see (and laugh to see!) the headland pine<br />
Embossed on changing fire:<br />
For close behind it, cooped<br />
Within a smallest span,<br />
In fury, to and fro and round and round,<br />
The routed leopards of the lightning ran:<br />
Bright, bright, inside their dungeon-bars, malign<br />
They ran; and ran till dawn, without a sound.<br />

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
